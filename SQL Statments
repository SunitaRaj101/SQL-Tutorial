1) Creating a Database and tables in it-
CREATE DATABASE databasename;
USE databasename;

2)Create Table-
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....);

CREATE TABLE Human (
    ID int,
    LastName varchar(255),
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Address varchar(255),
    City varchar(255)
);

3)SQL select-
SELECT column1, column2, ...  FROM table_name;
SELECT * FROM table_name;
SELECT DISTINCT col1,col2,col3... FROM table_name;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT col1) FROM table_name;   

4)Where-
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Operators in Where Clause are =, >, <, >=, <=, <>, BETWEEN, LIKE, IN

AND, OR, NOT WITH WHERE

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;

5)ORDER by- for Ascending and Descending order sorting
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;

6) INSERT- for inserting values into table
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

7)NULL 
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL/ IS NOT NULL;

8)UPDATE- for updating records
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

9)DELETE- for deleting records
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
DELETE FROM table_name;

10)TOP clause- for specifying the records to return
SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

11) MIN, MAX, AVG, COUNT, SUM-
SELECT MIN(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

12) LIKE operator- for searching of specified pattern
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;

Pattern  are these % or _

13) wildcards
%	Represents zero or more characters->	bl% ->finds bl, black, blue, and blob
_	Represents a single character->	h_t-> finds hot, hat, and hit
[]	Represents any single character within the brackets->	h[oa]t-> finds hot and hat, but not hit
^	Represents any character not in the brackets->	h[^oa]t-> finds hit, but not hot and hat
-	Represents any single character within the specified range->	c[a-b]t-> finds cat and cbt

14)IN, BETWEEN
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

15)Aliases
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name AS alias_name;

16)GROUP By
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);
